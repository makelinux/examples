## Features
* Minimal and practical, as self-descriptive as possible source code
  (please read references for explanations)
* Complete and ready to copy-paste into your application
* Runnable in place (no need to copy-paste snippets from documentation
  into an interpreter)
* Verifiable. Internal tests provide reliability and durability. You can easily add
  new features and run tests to ensure code validity

## Usage
* Read the sources
* 'assert' statements in the sources show expected results
* Run `make` to execute all examples, or run any example script manually (e.g., `./3.13.py`)
* Improvements and new features are welcome
